- Why are there specializations used in the implementation of FoamGridFactory?
- Do not use BasicUnitCube
- Tests don't build when 'make test' is called
- Replace make2din3dgrid by a gmsh file
- Does somebody really need the dgf code?
- Use shared_ptr for levelIndexSets_
- foamgridintersectioniterators: shortcut to getRealImplementation
